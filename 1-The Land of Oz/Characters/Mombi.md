# In the Original Universe

**Mombi** is an old Wicked Witch who lives in the magical [Land of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Land_of_Oz "Land of Oz"). She is first introduced in [L. Frank Baum](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/L._Frank_Baum "L. Frank Baum")'s second Oz book which serves as a sequel to the _[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz_(book) "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (book)")_, titled _[The Marvelous Land of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz "The Marvelous Land of Oz")_, published in 1904. She lived in the Northern quadrant of Oz called [Gillikin Country](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Gillikin_Country "Gillikin Country"). There Mombi was known as the Wicked Witch of the North, but only to be deposed by [Locasta Tattypoo](Locasta.md), also known as the [Good Witch of the North](Locasta.md), who overthrew her and proclaimed herself as the new, good ruler. Mombi would later go on to enchant the royal fairy-child of Fairy Queen [Lurline](Lurline.md) and the deceased mortal King of Oz [Pastoria](Pastoria.md), the princess baby [Ozma](Ozma.md) of Oz. Mombi remained the infant's guardian even after being deposed of her position. In order to prevent Ozma from ascending to the royal throne and disposing the humbug [Wizard](Oscar%20Diggs.md) one day, Mombi renamed the child Tippetarius aka "[Tip](Tippetarius.md)", and turned her from a beautiful girl to a ragga-muffin boy to disguise the heir from ever being recognized or found.

- Transformations were Mombi's forte.

"_What did you do with the girl, [Princess Ozma](Ozma.md); and at this question everyone slowly bent forward and listened eagerly for the reply. "I enchanted her," answered Mombi. "In what way?" Inquired Glinda. "I transformed her into -- into -- "Go on!" Glinda said. "To a boy!"_ "

### History of Mombi, The Wicked Witch of the North

Miss Mombi herself, is not a very powerful sorceress by nature, she is more of an imposter who wishes she was a real Wicked Witch like the legendary and infamous [Wicked Witch of the East](Nessarose%20Thropp%20(Wicked%20Wiki).md) or the [Wicked Witch of the West](Elphaba%20Thropp%20(Wicked%20Wiki).md). Real magic does not run in her blood like other sorceress in Oz such as the Princess [Gayelette](Gayelette.md) or [Glinda](Glinda.md), the Good Witch of the South. But despite not being born with the blessing of natural magic, Mombi is a very clever creature nonetheless. She enjoys being cruel and nasty, and even though she may be very old, she has dedicated her long-life to the magic arts and has mastered the art of black magic due to lots and lots of practice. As she was determined to make a living as a magical figure, regardless if she wasn't born into it.

Mombi once even successfully enslaved the King himself, old [Pastoria](Pastoria.md), who was the last King to rule Oz, prior to the Wizard's arrival. She became the Wicked Witch of the North, one of four [Wicked Witches](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Good_and_Wicked_Witches "Good and Wicked Witches") who had conspired to conquer Oz. _([Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Dorothy_and_the_Wizard_in_Oz "Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz"))_

After arriving in Oz, the Wizard of Oz made three visits to Mombi, and handed King Pastoria's baby daughter, Princess Ozma, over to the old witch. Mombi kept the infant heir to the throne successfully hidden away, transforming her into a boy named Tip. Having been the jailor of Ozma's father and grandfather before, Mombi treated Tip as a slave too, as "he" grew up. (_[The Marvelous Land of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz "The Marvelous Land of Oz")_)

During this time she fell in love with Cheeriobed, a prince from [Munchkin Country](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Munchkin_Country "Munchkin Country"), who was himself in love with Orin, a princess from a kingdom in the [Gillikin Country](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Gillikin_Country "Gillikin Country"). Mombi made herself young and beautiful and offered herself to him, but he refused. In anger, she transformed Orin into an old witch like herself. As for Cheeriobed, she left the monster [Quiberon](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Quiberon "Quiberon") to cut off his island kingdom in [Lake Orizon](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Lake_Orizon "Lake Orizon") from the rest of Oz. (_[The Giant Horse of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Giant_Horse_of_Oz "The Giant Horse of Oz")_)

She met her first match in the Tattypoo, who then became the Good Witch of the North. Tattypoo was the transformed Orin, who had forgotten her past life and become a powerful witch. When she came upon Mombi about to perform a cruel act, she challenged her, and won. (_[The Giant Horse of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Giant_Horse_of_Oz "The Giant Horse of Oz")_)

### Mombi's Child Slave Tip

After freeing the [Gillikins](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Gillikins "Gillikins") from Mombi's clutches, the Good Witch forbade any other witch to live in her domain. Even when defeated, Mombi was apparently still a survivor, and she made herself appear to be no more than a lowly wizardess, under the Good Witch of the North's reign.

She lived on a farmland which included corn fields, a four-horned cow, and some pigs. [Tip](Tippetarius.md) was her _de facto_ slave boy. _([The Marvelous Land of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz "The Marvelous Land of Oz"))_

One day Mombi visited a [Crooked Wizard](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Nikidik "Dr. Nikidik") and purchased the [Powder of Life](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Powder_of_Life "Powder of Life") from him, which she used to bring [Jack Pumpkinhead](Jack%20Pumpkinhead.md) to life. Tip had created Jack in order to scare her, so as punishment Mombi began brewing a [potion](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Liquid_of_Petrifaction "Liquid of Petrifaction") that would turn the boy into a marble statue. That night, Tip ran away, taking Jack with him.

When General [Jinjur's](Jinjur.md) [Army of Revolt](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_Revolt "Army of Revolt") conquered the [Emerald City](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Emerald_City "Emerald City"), Jinjur feared that the deposed [Scarecrow](Scarecrow.md) would return with the [Tin Woodman](Tin%20Man.md) to take back the throne of the kingdom. She asked Mombi for help and the old witch agreed, planning to recapture Tip, who had joined the deposed king of Oz.

After leaving the [Gillikin Country](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Gillikin_Country "Gillikin Country") to join forces with General Jinjur (the self-appointed new Queen of Oz), Mombi was no longer under the jurisdiction of the Good Witch of the North, but the unscrupulous old witch was forced to reckon with Glinda (who wanted to restore Princess Ozma to the throne). The wicked old witch tried to trick and escape Glinda with a series of transformations ranging from the maid [Jellia Jamb](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Jellia_Jamb "Jellia Jamb"), to a rose, and ultimately a Griffin, but the Good Sorceress was too clever, slick and resourceful. Glinda turned out to be an even tougher adversary than the Good Witch of the North, and ensured that Mombi could never harm anyone again.

Just before being disenchanted, Tip promised to provide for Mombi in her old age, despite the witch's fiendish actions. After forcing her to disenchant Princess Ozma, Glinda made Mombi drink a powerful draught that stripped the old witch of all her magic powers. _([The Marvelous Land of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz "The Marvelous Land of Oz"))_

### Non-magical life

Mombi then worked for many years as a cook in the tiny kingdom of Kimbaloo, for cooking was the closest to witchcraft she could come. Nonetheless she wasn't satisfied with it, and continually tried to remember some of her lost magic.

She was spied on by a little boy named Snip, when a goose that she was about to cook demanded to know what she had done with King [Pastoria](Pastoria.md). The goose turned out to be the King's former chamberlain, Pajuka, who Mombi had transformed into a goose prior to her defeat by the Good Witch of the North. Pajuka demanded that she restore the king, and so she, Pajuka, and Snip set out to find and restore him.

However, Mombi later failed to restore Pastoria, despite her honest intention to do so, because Humpy, a stunt dummy, was mistaken by [Kabumpo](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Kabumpo "Kabumpo") to be the transformed form of Pastoria, and so Mombi could not undo any enchantment on the dummy.

After Pastoria was restored, Dorothy suggested that Mombi be put out with a pail of water for her misdeeds, and Princess Ozma herself commanded it. (_[The Lost King of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lost_King_of_Oz "The Lost King of Oz")_). 

> _[L. Frank Baum](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/L._Frank_Baum "L. Frank Baum") never suggested that water could destroy_ all _witches, but Thompson certainly surmised as much. Moreover, Baum's original Dorothy and Ozma would never have had anyone executed; Dorothy was unwilling to kill the [Wicked Witch of the West](Elphaba%20Thropp%20(Wicked%20Wiki).md) even for the sake of seeing [Aunt Em](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Aunt_Em_(Novels) "Aunt Em (Novels)") and [Uncle Henry](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Uncle_Henry_(Novels) "Uncle Henry (Novels)") in Baum's [_The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz_(book) "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (book)"), while Ozma was unwilling to destroy her enemies even when they were on the verge of conquering her entire land in Baum's_ [The Emerald City of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Emerald_City_of_Oz "The Emerald City of Oz")_. Above all, the events in Thompson's book directly contradict Baum's specification that Mombi would be provided for by [Ozma](Ozma.md) herself in her old age._

> _David Tai's "Executive Decisions" (from_ Oziana _#38) retcons this discrepancy by indicating that Ozma had in fact not executed Mombi but made her instead drink from the Waters of Oblivion._

> _Outside of Oziana, The Forbidden Fountain of Oz_, by Elois Jarvis and Lauren Lynn McGraw, also retcons Mombi's execution, with Jack Pumpkinhead simply saying that she lost her magic, as in_ Marvellous Land_, rather than bringing up her execution_

### Return

Many years later, the Wizard of Oz accidentally mixed too much magic into paint that was being used by many inhabitants of Oz to paint historical Oz scenes onto one of the walls in the Emerald City. One of the paintings was of Mombi, and it came to life. It promptly escaped from the wall and fled the Emerald City, having grabbed the Wizard's black bag of magic. But [Jenny Jump](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Jenny_Jump "Jenny Jump") leaped up using her fairy foot and recovered the bag before Mombi could get away. So Mombi was forced to go into hiding, and she hid in the cabin of [Davy Jones](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Davy_Jones "Davy Jones"). She remained there until discovered and returned to the painting. (_[Lucky Bucky in Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Lucky_Bucky_in_Oz "Lucky Bucky in Oz")_)

_It is debatable whether this is the real Mombi or not. She certainly has all of Mombi's personality and memories. However, the other paintings made from the same paint also seemed to share characteristics of the people they were based on, even those who were still alive. Nevertheless, people react to her as if she were the real Mombi._

# In the Wicked Universe

**La Mombey Impeccata, the Pale Queen of Sorcery**, is a powerful witch who would rise in prominence and become the Eminence of the [Free State of Munchkinland](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Munchkinland "Munchkinland"), chosen by the people to lead the nation into civil war against [Loyal Oz](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Oz "Oz").

## In The Novels

Before the coming of the [Wizard](Oscar%20Diggs.md), Mombey was an adviser to [Pastorius](Pastoria.md), the Ozma Regent who was also her relative. After the Wizard overthrew Pastorius, he gave the regent's baby daughter, [Ozma Tippetarius](Ozma.md), to La Mombey to keep and hide away forever. The witch transformed the princess into a kitchen boy she would call "[Tip](Tippetarius.md)" and use as her personal servant.

For a good many years Mombey was a ferocious old hag, with bristles on her chin and a bent back that caused her to have to walk with a cane (Tip was often used as her ambulatory cane).

To get the appearance of a younger woman, she, with Tip in tow, traveled by sand sledge across the deserts surrounding [Oz](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Oz "Oz") and came to the duchy principality of Ev, where she was met by the duchess (presumably Langwidere), who had the ability to change the shape of her head and body to whatever pleased her. It’s unknown what happed after that, but when they traveled back to Oz, they arrived in [Gillikin](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Gillikin "Gillikin") and while the two of them were riding the train Mombey went to the powder room and returned as a younger, beautiful woman, much to Tip’s shock.

### _Son of a Witch_

La Mombey encounters Liir while traveling with Tip. She jokingly offers Tip in exchange for [Elphaba Thropp](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Elphaba_Thropp "Elphaba Thropp")'s broom, but Liir declines.
### _A Lion Among Men_

Mombey is mentioned by [Mister Mikko](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Mister_Mikko "Mister Mikko") and [Professor Lenx](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Professor_Lenx "Professor Lenx") as being the Eminent Pastor of the hamlet of Old Pastoria in Munchkinland. She is long thought to be the one to pick up the free state where [Nessarose Thropp (Wicked Wiki)](Nessarose%20Thropp%20(Wicked%20Wiki).md) left it after she died. Mombey is said to keep to herself, though lacks the conviction of exceptionalism that Nessarose possessed.

### _[Out of Oz](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Out_of_Oz "Out of Oz")

Mombey is introduced in _Out of Oz_ as the new leader of Munchkinland, having managed to become elevated to Eminence of Munchkinland, due to her distant relationship with Pastorius.

She puts [Dorothy Gale](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Dorothy_Gale "Dorothy Gale") on trial for the death of Nessarose Thropp, as a distraction for her plan to attack the [Emerald City](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/The_Emerald_City "The Emerald City"). She also tries to forcefully recruit Animals into the Munchkinland army by casting a spell on the bridges in [Bright Lettins](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Bright_Lettins "Bright Lettins"), which prevents the Animals from leaving. [Brrr (Wicked Wiki)](Brrr%20(Wicked%20Wiki).md), however, manages to push through it when rescuing Dorothy.

After having him captured and brought back to [Colwen Grounds](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Colwen_Grounds "Colwen Grounds"), Mombey transforms Liir into an elephant and threatens him with death if he does not help her decipher the [Grimmerie](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Grimmerie "Grimmerie"). She also reveals to him that she was the sorceress who placed the human spell on Princess [Nastoya.](Nastoya.md) Mombey has [Trism](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Trism_bon_Cavalish "Trism bon Cavalish") use Liir to help him perfect the spell to control her army of dragons, which are trained to fight Loyal Oz. After acknowledging each others choices, Liir agrees to follow Mombey's way.

With the Emerald City brought to its knees by the dragon attacks, a parley between Mombey and [Shell Heart](Shell%20Heart.md) is called forth in the city. During the subsequent conference for surrender, Mombey reveals that Liir is not dead in his elephant form. By using the Grimmerie to attempt to revert Liir to his natural form, Mombey uses a spell called "To Call the Lost Forward" however, something goes wrong, as the spell Mombey uses to summon back Liir, summons more than just Liir; the spell inadvertently also returns Tip to his true form (Ozma), restores [Rain](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Rain "Rain")'s natural green skin, and wipes away Mombey’s glamour, returning her to her original, decrepit old hag self.

She is imprisoned at the end of the novel after the return of Ozma to the throne.
## Description

Mombey takes on many appearances throughout _Out of Oz_, majority of the time appearing as a tall, striking woman with a compelling voice, however, she wears a glamour to disguise the fact that she is actually an old and decrepit hag.

In one scene she appears wearing a full shimmery-coppery silk garment draped, uncinched, from the fabric yoke at her shoulders. Her skin smooth, with a beautifully cut yet impassive face.

In another scene Mombey’s face appears less chiseled and more delicate, fragile, and sorrowful. Her hair in a crisp chignon, looking more dark and spikier. She is wearing another tidal barrage of silks, flowered with white petals against maroon.

Again later, Mombey appears more mature, with silvery blonde hair and painted lips. Here she wielded a magic staff.

Later Mombey appears with a head of flaxen-red hair and a stern and loving expression.

Around the end of the novel Mombey appears as a woman of gravity with a furrowed brow and slivering hair, and she walked with a cane.
