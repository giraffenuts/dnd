**Tippetarius** (called **Tip** for short) is a fictional character created by L. Frank Baum, author of the Oz legacy. His first appearance is in Baum's second Oz book titled _[The Marvelous Land of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz "The Marvelous Land of Oz")_, published in 1904. Tip is introduced as a young, ragga-muffin adolescent orphan who was thought to be just the peasant slave boy living in the magical [Land of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Land_of_Oz "Land of Oz"). He belonged to the old [Gillikin](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Gillikins "Gillikins") Witch of the Northern quadrant named [Mombi](Mombi.md).
## Oz History

For as long as he could remember, Tip had lived with the old witch [Mombi](Mombi.md) on a farm in the [Gillikin Country](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Gillikin_Country "Gillikin Country") of the magical [Land of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Land_of_Oz "Land of Oz"). She was his guardian, but she treated the boy as a slave, always ordering him around and talking down to him. And for this cruel treatment, Tip hated Mombi.

One day while Mombi was away, Tip carved a face in one of her pumpkins. Then he made a body for it out of wood, dressed him in some old clothes, and named him [Jack Pumpkinhead](Jack%20Pumpkinhead.md). Tip set Jack up in the roadway to scare Mombi, but instead of being frightened she used the creation to test the [Powder of Life](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Powder_of_Life "Powder of Life"). As punishment for trying to scare her, Mombi began brewing a [potion](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Liquid_of_Petrifaction "Liquid of Petrifaction") that would turn Tip into a marble statue. That night, Tip stole the Powder of Life and ran away, taking Jack with him. 

On their way, Tip used the Powder of Life to animate a [Sawhorse](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Sawhorse_(Novels) "Sawhorse (Novels)") for them to ride upon, making the journey easier. The Sawhorse soon ran away with Jack, leaving Tip behind. The boy encountered an [army of girls](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_Revolt "Army of Revolt") led by [General Jinjur](Jinjur.md) and followed them to the [Emerald City](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Emerald_City "Emerald City") where he was reunited with Jack and the Sawhorse. 

There he met the [Scarecrow King](Scarecrow.md) of the Emerald City. When General Jinjur conquered the city and overthrew the Scarecrow, Tip, Jack, and the Scarecrow escaped aboard the Sawhorse and went to the [Winkie Country](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Winkie_Country "Winkie Country") where they sought the help of the [Tin Woodman](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Tin_Woodman_(Novels) "Tin Woodman (Novels)").

## Characteristics

Because of all the work and labor he did for [Mombi](Mombi.md) as her servant, Tip was a strong and rugged boy. Between chores Tip took time to enjoy himself, so he knew how to work hard and how to have fun. Tip is portrayed as a sympathetic character, one who doesn't feel sorry for himself, which makes him all that more likable.
## Spoilers

Tip was later revealed to be the enchanted form of the long-lost daughter of the late King of Oz, long before the [Wizard](Oscar%20Diggs.md) arrived and took over. The King was only known simply as [Pastoria](Pastoria.md). [Ozma](Ozma.md) is the last surviving heir to the imperial Throne of Fairy Queen [Lurline](Lurline.md). She now resides in the [Royal Palace of Oz](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Royal_Palace_of_Oz "Royal Palace of Oz") which is in the [Emerald City](https://oz.fandom.com/wiki/Emerald_City "Emerald City"). And she is the child Queen of Oz and its rightful ruler.
