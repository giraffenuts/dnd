# Trism bon Cavalish
**Trism bon Calavish** is a character primarily featured in _Son of a Witch_ and _Out of Oz_, though the character would later return in _The Witch of Maracoor._

He was a soldier and lover of [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir Thropp]] who specialized in training and taking care of dragons, which became instrumental on both sides of the civil war between Loyal Oz and The Free State of Munchkinland.

Trism was born to a Gillikinese farming family, and he attended St. Prowd's school before joining the Emerald City Army.

## _Son of a Witch_

Trism is introduced as a young soldier in the Emerald City's Home Guard where he meets a young [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]]. Many years later, he is in charge of the training the dragons for the Emperor's army. He has come to despise the cause and he helps [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]] burn the dragon stables to the ground, killing the dragons. After this, they both become fugitives. He and [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]] flee the city together and become lovers, and they make their way to the Cloister of St. Glinda. Trism escapes the convent under the guise of being Lady Glinda's manservant, then he makes his way to Apple Press Farm to find a pregnant Candle. Trism, betrayed at the fact that [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]] had a wife and child, leaves Apple Press Farm before [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]] arrives. He is then apprehended and tortured by General Cherrystone's forces, who flay him alive in order to gain information on the whereabouts of [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]] and the Grimmerie. Fleeing Loyal Oz, Trism escapes to the Free State of Munchkinland.

## _Out of Oz_

Years later, Trism is now working for La Mombey and once again training dragons, however this time, training them to attack the Emerald City and the Emperor. When [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]] is captured by La Mombey, Trism goes to see him and explains how he searched for [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]], and shows him the extensive scars from his previous torture. The two admit that they still love each other and Trism begs [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]] to help him decipher the Grimmerie to help train the dragons and La Mombey strike out against the Emerald City. When [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]] refuses to help La Mombey, Trism leaves with her, telling [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]] "Mercy on your soul," to which [[Liir Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Liir]] replies "Mercy on your's." The dragon attack is then carried out with precision on the Emerald City. As it turns out, Trism did not need the extra help of the Grimmerie; his experience with dragons proved to be great enough.
