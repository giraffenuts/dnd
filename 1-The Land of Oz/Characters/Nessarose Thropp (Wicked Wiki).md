**Nessarose Thropp**, the **Eminence of Munchkinland**, known to her subjects as the tyrant, **Wicked Witch of the East**, is a character from the novel _Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West_ by author Gregory Maguire.

Nessarose is the spoiled younger sister of [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]], the "Wicked Witch of the West". In the novel, [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]] is considered a tomboy second to her very beautiful and attractive, but delicately handicapped younger sister, and is often expected to put the needs of Nessarose before her own.

During her rule over Munchkinland, she is dubbed "_The Wicked Witch of the East"_, for her one sided business deals, cruel ways, and overall use of sorcery to control her people. Nessarose meets her demise when Dorothy Gale's farmhouse, which was carried by a Kansas cyclone, unexpectedly lands in Oz and tragically crushes her to death. Thus, enabling Dorothy to become the new owner of her magic slippers.

In _Wicked,_ Nessarose was born at the Thropp family estate of Colwen Grounds, and was the second child of Melena Thropp, and the eldest child of Frexspar The Godly, though her father believes her to be his second child. Like her older sister, [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]], she was born with a deformity, though her deformity was that she born with no arms. It is implied this was due to the medicine that her mother took to prevent another green-skinned child. She spent most of her early life in the Quadling Country due to her parents' Unionist missionary work. Her mother died giving birth to her brother when she was young, and her father and Nanny gave much of their attention to her. Frexspar would later explain that this was because he did not know for sure whether she was his child, so he instead saw her as the child of him, Melena and their duel lover: Turtle Heart, and a symbol of his love for both of them.

## Shiz and Silver Slippers

Nessarose was enrolled at Shiz University's college of Crage Hall at the tender age of fourteen, due to Nanny replacing Galinda’s Ama Clutch. She is described as fashionable, shy, proper, and as pious as her father. Because of her spoiled upbringing, [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]] and Nanny insist on changing the room around for her, much to Galinda's chagrin. As a parting gift, her father sends her a pair of slippers decorated with silver glass beads. The slippers are dazzling and have a chameleon effect so that they appear in different colors according to the lighting.

Nessarose eventually becomes part of [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]]'s charmed social circle, though her piety caused some conflict, mainly with Glinda's choice to study sorcery. After Ama Clutch's death, she, [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]], and Glinda are called into Madame Morrible's office and offered the chance to become an “Adept of Magic”, secret ministerial positions where they would reign from behind-the-scenes under the central leadership of the Wizard of Oz, though a spell is cast on them so they will not remember any of the conversation until Morrible wished. Nessarose is later devastated by [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]]'s abandonment of Shiz and takes comfort with Glinda, who becomes a close friend and confidant, though she also falls deeper into her Unionist religion and drives away most of her other friends.

## Becoming the Wicked Witch of the East

With [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]] missing and presumed dead, Nessarose eventually inherits her great-grandfather's title of Eminent Thropp. Later, on account of her harsh theological measures and for the use of sorcery to control her subjects, Nessarose would become the sole leader of Munchkinland, the _Eminence of Munckinland_.

The burning of a grange where opposition meetings were taking place, a reported rape of a couple of Munchkinlanders maidens following a cotillion of the Wizard’s army garrisoned near Dragon’s Cupboard, a Massacre at Far Applerue, and the heavy taxation on farms crops had been “the last straw” as far as Nessarose was concerned. At Colwen Grounds, she communicated her revolutionary outrage through a letter directly towards the Wizard and addressed the senior men among the farming communities and kept her religious agenda in check, and in the end, there was a unanimous approval for secession. Declaring Munchkinland‘s independence, Nessarose would have the province break away from Loyal Oz. Her justification for performing such cruel actions is that she is so "righteous" as to do whatever she deems fit.

As Eminence of Munchkinland, she regularly takes requests of magic from her subjects. One such act was to cast a spell on the ax of Nick Chopper, so that it would kill him. Nick Chopper would later become the Tin Woodsman because of the accident. When [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]] visits her, she offers her a chance to stay with her and join her in ruling over Munchkinland, however [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]] refuses. Nessarose also promises to leave her magic slippers to [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]] in her will when she passes away.

## The Matter of Dorothy, the Aftermath, and her Legacy

During a ceremony honoring perfect attendance to religious classes to children in the hamlet of Center Munch, Nessarose is ultimately killed when Dorothy Gale's farmhouse lands on top of her, crushing her to death. After her demise, her ministers, particularly Prime Minister Nipp, the appointed interim-leader of Munchkinland, would claim the title of Eminent Thropp and therefore, the title of Eminence of Munchkinland, to be extinct, however, their right to do this is thought dubious. As for her house at Colwen Grounds, the newly liberated Munchkinlanders would both ransack and graffiti what the eminence left there, leaving their painted signs of protest all over the grounds, reading such revolutionary slogans as "SHE WALKED ALL OVER US", "NOW THE SHOE'S ON THE OTHER FOOT", and "WALK ALL OVER YOU YOU OLD WITCH".

Initially, Nessarose is remembered negatively due to her use of magic and religious fervour to subdue her people; Glinda even sends Dorothy back home to avoid the political conflict she may face for killing Nessarose. However, by the time of _Out of Oz_, the Munchkinlander’s views of Nessarose has shifted drastically, and she is now viewed as "Saint Nessarose, The Mother of Munchkinland", a national hero, which leads to a newly-returned Dorothy to be put on trial for killing her. However, it is revealed that the trial is nothing more than a political maneuver by Munchkinland's new leader, Mombey, Nessarose is often close-minded and vain, in keeping with Maguire's cynicism throughout the novel towards religion in general. In fact, the extent of her Unionist religious dedication causes even her father, the intensely pious Frexspar, to worry that she may be "too devout". 

## Book to Musical Differences

Like many other characters in the Broadway adaptation of _Wicked_, Nessarose is portrayed very differently from the novel. She was originally played by Michelle Federer. In the musical, Nessarose is not chosen as a sorceress by Madame Morrible, and while the character of the musical does have arms, she is instead a wheelchair user. As in the novel, she is seen as beautiful, but the adaptation presents her as a more tragic character, attending Shiz University with [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]], who often embarrasses her in her attempts to "make a difference". In an effort to shoo away a persistent love-struck Munchkin named Boq so that her own relationship with Fiyero can develop, Galinda arranges a date between him and Nessarose. Thereafter, Boq unhappily becomes a point of love obsession for Nessarose, unlike in the novel, where she had little contact with Boq. Because her father was governor of Munchkinland, Nessarose takes control of the province following his death, and during her rule, she slowly becomes evil and tyrannical. She enslaves Boq, and in an attempt to use [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]]'s spells to punish him for professing his love for Glinda, accidentally causes his heart to disappear. As [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]] begins to save Boq by turning him into the Tin Woodman, Nessarose declares herself 'The Wicked Witch of the East'.

As in the novel, Nessarose receives the magical slippers as a gift from her father, but they are enchanted by [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]], rather than Glinda, to give her the ability to walk. The musical does not refer to Turtle Heart or Shell, and thus it is implied that Nessarose was the legitimate child of Frex and Melena. The musical also shows that it was Madame Morrible who created the fateful cyclone, as a trap to draw [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]] out of hiding.

It is also interesting to note that, in the novel, it is heavily hinted at that the Grimmerie, and that [[Elphaba Thropp (Wicked Wiki)|Elphaba]]'s ability to read only a portion of it is because of her half-human, half-Ozian birth. In contrast, in the musical, the Grimmerie is obviously a book from Oz (since it is stated that The Wizard. This would make Nessarose's ability to read it, albeit backwards, in The Wicked Witch of the East scene a bit incongruous.
