**Mister Boss** is a dwarf who claims to be an immortal being sent to [Oz](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Oz "Oz") to prevent the [Grimmerie](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Grimmerie "Grimmerie") from returning to Earth. He owns and operates the [Clock of the Time Dragon](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Clock_of_the_Time_Dragon "Clock of the Time Dragon").

## In the novels[[](https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwicked.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FMister_Boss%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D1&uselang=en "Sign in to edit")]

In _[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Wicked:_The_Life_and_Times_of_the_Wicked_Witch_of_the_West "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West")_, he first appears in [Rush Margins](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Rush_Margins "Rush Margins"), operating the Clock of the Time Dragon while [Frexspar The Godly](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Frexspar_The_Godly "Frexspar The Godly") protests against it.

He later appears at the door of the Philosophy Club with [Yackle](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Yackle "Yackle").

His final appearance in Wicked comes during the end when he grants [Elphaba](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Elphaba_Thropp "Elphaba Thropp") a private audience with the Time Dragon, revealing her ancestry.

In _[A Lion Among Men](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/A_Lion_Among_Men "A Lion Among Men")_, Mister Boss, now with his apprentice, [Ilianora](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Illianora "Illianora"), travels to the [Cloister of Saint Glinda](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Cloister_of_Saint_Glinda "Cloister of Saint Glinda"), bringing the Grimmerie with it.

In _[Out of Oz](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Out_of_Oz "Out of Oz")_, he becomes part of the "accidental family" for [Rain](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Rain "Rain"), although he loses none of his blunt attitude. He eventually marries [Sister Apothecaire](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Sister_Apothecaire "Sister Apothecaire") (calling her Little Daffy) after she leaves the mauntery. He has strong feelings towards the Clock of the Time Dragon and is deeply upset when it refuses to speak to him anymore. After its destruction he becomes very silent, which most of the characters pick up on, but thanks to his wife he manages to gain a new sense of purpose. He travels with [Brrr](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Brrr "Brrr") to [Munchkinland](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Munchkinland "Munchkinland") to rescue [Dorothy Gale](https://wicked.fandom.com/wiki/Dorothy_Gale "Dorothy Gale").
