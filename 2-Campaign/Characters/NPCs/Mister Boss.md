>All our lives are activity without meaning; we burrow rat-like into life and we squirm rat-like through it and rat-like we are flung into our graves at the end. Now and then, why shouldnâ€™t we hear a voice of prophecy, or see a miracle play? Beneath the apparent sham and indignity of our rat-like lives, a humble pattern and meaning still applies! Come nearer, my good people, and watch what a little extra knowledge augurs for your lives! The Time Dragon sees before and beyond and within the truth of your sorry span of years here! Look at what it shows you!
