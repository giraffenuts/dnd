Once an inanimate child's toy made from patches of cotton cloth, burlap, and leather, Scraps belonged to Tip, the young farm hand of Mombi the Witch. One day, Mombi tested her Powder of Life on Jack Pumpkinhead, the garden figure created by Tip. After witnessing the powder bring Jack to life, Tip planned to sneak into Mombi's forbidden shed and steal some of the powder to bring his beloved doll to life. That night, Tip gave life to Scraps, as he began to imagine the adventures the three of them -- Jack, Scraps, and Tip -- would embark upon. Mombi, however, was not so thrilled. She was furious at Tip for defying her and as punishment, she locked Scraps up in her shed for months, only to release her under the conditions Scraps served her every request.
