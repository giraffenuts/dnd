Some notes for Macy's character:

Since your race is human, you get to add +1 to all of your base stats.

I've been thinking, and I also like the idea of your character having draconic blood, instead of fairy. This would also make sense for the plot. If you want to change this, it is up to you but I thought I would recommend some other changes if this sounds appealing:

For the narrative: 
- Your character would not know that you have draconic blood or which type of dragon. I already have an idea for which dragon gave you your powers which I can share you you if you would like to know more about your character's arc.
Mechanics:
- Use Draconic Bloodline for your Sorcerous Origin
	- This gives you the Draconic Resilience feature, which makes your **AC 13+DEX**
		- If you were to switch your WIS/INT score for your DEX score then this would raise your AC from 11 to 15.
	- It also allows you to be resistant to one type of damage, depending on which dragon ancestor you choose. However, the dragon ancestor I have in mind for you is not represented in the rules, so I would recommend you take a **resistance to necrotic or psychic damage**.



**Why are you going to Southstairs?**

You work as an informant for Glinda, who has sent you on a mission to look for Scarecrow. Everyone believes that the Scarecrow died in 'an unfortunate accident involving a beaker of lighter fluid', leaving the Throne Ministry vacant and allowing the Emperor Apostle to usurp power, but Glinda believes that he is still alive and imprisoned in a maximum-security ward in Southstairs.
