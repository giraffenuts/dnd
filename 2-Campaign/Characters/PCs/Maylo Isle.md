A Quadling from the village of Bengda. When the fires broke out, Maylo was just 8 years old. The Home Guard decided to punish the small village for its refusal to pay excessive fines and noncompliance in the search for the missing Viceroy. Maylo's parents instructed her older brother, Milo, to take her and flee the village while they prepared to lead a retaliatory attack against the Home Guard. Uncertain of their fate, Maylo never saw her parents again. She and her brother fled west to the Vinkus. During the long and arduous journey, Maylo's brother fell very ill. At only 9 years old, Maylo searched for help. To her dismay she saw no signs of human civilization. One day she came across a couple of Li-Mon-Eags. While she was terrified at first, she came to realize they did not want to harm her. Instead, they aided Maylo and her brother, sharing their food and shelter, and tending to her brother's illness. Unfortunately, their efforts were not enough and her brother died only a few weeks later.

Without a place to go and no family left, Maylo decided to remain with this family of Li-Mon-Eags, learning their way of life and how to survive in the wild. Maylo became very close with the Animal family that fostered her. After many years, the Li-Mon-Eags who took her in had a cub, whom she considered her own brother. But the cycle of life continued, and her Animal parents became more feeble with every passing month. Eventually, they too passed, and it was just Maylo and her young Li-Mon-Eag brother against the world.
