## Secrets and Clues  
#### For Maylo:
- [ ] DC 10: General Cherrystone was stationed in Quadling Country. The informant assumes that he was the one giving the orders during the burning of Bengda village, but he couldn't have participated because he was in Qhoyre at the time.
- [ ] DC 15: Cherrystone charged the village enormously large fines, knowing that they wouldn't be able to pay up, just so that he had an excuse to terrorize the village and make an example out its people in order to scare the nearby city of Qhoyre into cooperating with the Home Guard.
- [ ] DC 20: Some of the Bengdians that lead the revolt against the Home Guard were captured and taken alive by General Cherrystone.
#### For Merle:
- [ ] DC 10: When Nor was being held in the Inner Ward, she once saw the Scarecrow being escorted to the Central Ward. Although it didn't appear to her that he was restrained, she felt as if he looked distressed. 
- [ ] DC 15: Nor tells Merle that an old rumor that circulated through the Southstairs resistance was that Shell orchestrated the "dethroning" of Scarecrow to facilitate his own takeover. 
- [ ] DC 20: Brrr tells Merle that the Scarecrow that sat upon the Throne in the Emerald Palace didn't feel like the same Scarecrow that he had journeyed with. Something about him had changed drastically.
#### For Scraps:
- [ ] DC 10: A shady vendor in Market Square tells Scraps that *Glegg's Box of Mixed Magic* is hidden away somewhere in the 
- [ ] DC 15: Brrr tells Scraps that he doesn't buy the narrative that Mombi likes to tell about Tip She likes to portray Tip as a poor orphan boy that she adopted out of the kindness of her own heart, but Brrr thinks there is much more to the story. He shares his speculation that Mombi has placed a spell on Tip to keep him obedient.
- [ ] DC 20: Brr informs Scraps of the myth of Mombi's past. Stating that some people believe her to be much older than she lets on, and is truly the old Wicked Witch of the North that Glinda defeated more than 30 years ago. 
#### For Siegfried:
- [ ] Secret description
- [ ] 
#### For The Party:
##### The Cullings
- [ ] DC 10: At first it was just reports from over in the Cages of Animals disappearing, then we started hearing claims that human prisoners were disappearing too. There were rumors of things happening in the Inner Ward, but there isn't much communication in and out of it since it is the maximum-security wing of the prison. Not too long after the rumors started though, Nor got evidence that the cullings had begun in the Outer Ward now, too.
- [ ] DC 15: People aren't just being transferred to another Ward during the cullings. Several prisoners have seen trails of blood that lead into the Center Ward, a place no prisoner has ever come back from.
##### Liir
- [ ] DC 10: Nor and Liir grew up in the Vinkus together; they were very close throughout childhood, right up until Nor was abducted.
- [ ] DC 15: Although he will deny it, Liir is Elphaba's son and he carries her same magical abilities, albeit they were still latent when Nor last saw him.
- [ ] DC 20: Brrr reveals that Nor and Liir are half siblings.

##### Dragons
- [ ] DC 20: 
- [ ] DC 25: Brrr is in possession the page of the Grimmerie that Shell used to resurrect the dragons in Oz. The page is torn and singed around the edges 

## Fantastic Locations  

**Munchkinland**: The "breadbasket" of Oz. Munchkinland is a large agrarian province with many small to mid-size towns atop rolling green hills surrounded by vast farmland. A large mountain range divides Munchkinland from its southern neighbor, Quadling Country. Directly to its north are the profitable emerald mines of the Glikkus. The Munchkin river runs from the Restwater Lake in the west well into the east, giving life to the land it divides. 

**Yellow Brick Road**: Beginning at Shiz University, the Yellow Brick Road follows the Gillikin railway until it reaches the Emerald City. Emerging from the southern gate of the city, dubbed the Munchkin Mousehole, the Yellow Brick Road continues along the Munchkin river. Branching off into two paths, one following the Munchkin River all the way to the capital city of Munchkinland, Central Munch, and one continuing straight south between mountain ranges until it finally reaches the city built upon the marshes, the provincial capital of Quadling Country, Qhoyre. 
  
**Emerald City**: aspect, aspect, aspect  
  
**Southstairs**: Beneath the glittering spires and bustling streets of the Emerald City lies a dark reality of Oz, a labyrinthian prison-city repurposed from the skeletal remains of a coal mine. Parts of the mines are still operational, but those who work them don't do it by their own free will. Although there is a "*Free District*" that contains the *Market Square* and some slums known as "*The Hive*", the Emperor Apostle has turned most of the complex into a prison system for Emerald City's worst criminals, disruptive dissenters, and his political enemies.
A lot of professional Animals ended up there over the decades, cheek by jowl with murderers, pedophiles. Rapists. Political pamphleteers. 

- Entering: Flickering gas lamps cast jagged shadows on the cracked and mossy stone walls. The air is cool and smells of dirt and mildew. The constant clanging of pickaxes ring throughout the hollow tunnels

# Session Notes

# Post Session Notes
### What happened this session:

- The party was kidnapped and taken to an old mansion
- When their blindfolds were removed, they were greeted by a lion in a silk robe, wearing reading glasses low on his nose, holding a book in one hand and a glass of scotch in the other.
- The lion revealed himself to be Brrr, the Cowardly Lion that journeyed with Dorothy Gale and was at Kiamo Ko when Elphaba was killed.
- Brrr tells the party he has been watching them closely for a while now and believes they are the only people who can help him.
- Brrr wants the party to go to the Emerald City, infiltrate Southstairs, find Nor Tigelaar, see if she has any useful information on the Grimmerie, and - if they're able to - break Nor out.
- The party each has their own reason to go as well - which is why Brrr chose them:
	- **Maylo** has learned that there's a Home Guard defector that could have information on the burning of her village and maybe even what happened to her parents
	- **Merle** has been asked by Glinda to investigate intel that the Scarecrow is alive and imprisoned in Southstairs
	- **Scraps** is looking for *Glegg's Box of Mixed Magic*, which she believes could help her rescue Tip from Mobi's farm. She has been informed that it may be hidden somewhere in Southstairs.
	- **Siegfried**'s friend Meefe was arrested and sent into the depths of Southstairs in a very public display. Fried wants to find and save their friend.
- The party accepts and sleeps at Brrr's mansion.
	- **Maylo** agrees on the condition that her brother Lip be brought to her. She then makes a difficult decision to leave him with Brrr, afraid to endanger him on their mission.
- They wake up in the morning, gathers last minute equipment from Brrr's armory, and departs on the Yellow Brick Road.
- The party travels on the road for several hours until they reach the edge of a forest, when Maylo senses danger from nearby bushes.
- Attempting to attack the bush, Maylo accidentally hits the wagon with her javelin, causing the wheel to fall off and crash.
- The party encounters two Goozzle Goblin in the forest between the Pine Barrens and Restwater Lake. They finally defeat the creatures after realizing they can only kill them by cutting out their tongues.
	- The party gains 2x Goozzle Goblin tongues
- End of session

### Where did we leave off?
- Some Goozzle Goblins ambushed the wagon where the Yellow Brick Road enters the forest between the Pine Barrens and Restwater Lake.
- The wheel of the wagon broke when Maylo missed her target
