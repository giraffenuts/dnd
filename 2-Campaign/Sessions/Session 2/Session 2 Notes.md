## Secrets and Clues  
#### For Maylo
- [ ] DC 10: General Cherrystone was stationed in Quadling Country. The informant assumes that he was the one giving the orders during the burning of Bengda village, but he couldn't have participated because he was in Qhoyre at the time.
- [ ] DC 15: Cherrystone charged the village enormously large fines, knowing that they wouldn't be able to pay up, just so that he had an excuse to terrorize the village and make an example out its people in order to scare the nearby city of Qhoyre into cooperating with the Home Guard.
- [ ] DC 20: Some of the Bengdians that lead the revolt against the Home Guard were captured and taken alive by General Cherrystone.
#### For Merle
- [ ] DC 10: When Nor was being held in the Inner Ward, she once saw the Scarecrow being escorted to the Central Ward. Although it didn't appear to her that he was restrained, she felt as if he looked distressed. 
- [ ] DC 15: Nor tells Merle that an old rumor that circulated through the Southstairs resistance was that Shell orchestrated the "dethroning" of Scarecrow to facilitate his own takeover. 
- [ ] DC 20: Brrr tells Merle that the Scarecrow that sat upon the Throne in the Emerald Palace didn't feel like the same Scarecrow that he had journeyed with. Something about him had changed drastically.
#### For Scraps
- [ ] DC 10: A shady vendor in Market Square tells Scraps that ==*Glegg's Box of Mixed Magic*== is hidden away somewhere in ==the Vaults== 
- [ ] DC 15: Brrr tells Scraps that he doesn't buy the narrative that Mombi likes to tell about Tip She likes to portray Tip as a poor orphan boy that she adopted out of the kindness of her own heart, but Brrr thinks there is much more to the story. He shares his speculation that Mombi has placed a spell on Tip to keep him obedient.
- [ ] DC 20: Brr informs Scraps of the myth of Mombi's past. Stating that some people believe her to be much older than she lets on, and is truly the old Wicked Witch of the North that Glinda defeated more than 30 years ago. 
#### For Siegfried
- [ ] DC 15: Meef is being held in the Cages, on the outskirts of the Outer Ward.
- [ ] 
#### For The Party
**Mister Boss and Southstairs Entrance:**
- [ ] DC 10: Southstairs is known to have several secret entrances on the streets of Emerald City. But those who have been around for a while would know that before Southstairs was repurposed to hold the Wizard's worst enemies, it was part of the largest mining complex in Oz and employed most of the city's labor force.
- [ ] DC 15: There's an entrance to the mine 
**The Cullings:**
- [ ] DC 10: At first it was just reports from over in the Cages of Animals disappearing, then we started hearing claims that human prisoners were disappearing too. There were rumors of things happening in the Inner Ward, but there isn't much communication in and out of it since it is the maximum-security wing of the prison. Not too long after the rumors started though, Nor got evidence that the cullings had begun in the Outer Ward now, too.
- [ ] DC 15: People aren't just being transferred to another Ward during the cullings. Several prisoners have seen trails of blood that lead into the Center Ward, a place no prisoner has ever come back from.
- [ ] DC 15: A member of the party pickpockets a guard, obtaining a note that notifies the guard they're on "==*selection duty*==" tonight and they must report to the Central Ward at 2 AM.
- [ ] DC 20: A member of the party overhears a conversation between guards in which a woman asks another guard if he's on "==*selection duty*==" tonight. The guard confirms that he is and a second male guard asks if he's ever actually seen them in person. He says he hasn't, since he doesn't have clearance to enter the lair below the Central Ward, but sometimes he'll hear "chilling screams" coming from beneath the "==*prison layer*==".
**Liir:**
- [ ] DC 10: Nor and Liir grew up in the Vinkus together; they were very close throughout childhood, right up until Nor was abducted.
- [ ] DC 15: Although he will deny it, Liir is Elphaba's son and he carries her same magical abilities, albeit they were still latent when Nor last saw him.
- [ ] DC 20: Brrr reveals that Nor and Liir are half siblings.
**Dragons:**
- [ ] A note found on one of the guards is signed by or mentions Menacier (Trism) bon Cavalish.
- [ ] DC 25: Brrr is in possession the page of the Grimmerie that Shell used to resurrect the dragons in Oz. The page is torn and singed around the edges
- [ ] DC 25:

# Post Session Notes
### What happened this session:
- After defeating the Goozzle Goblins, the party check on Merle and Scott, their escort sent by Brrr.
	- **Merle** is seriously injured and Scott is unconscious from the crash.
	- While **Scraps** helps **Merle** up, **Fried** checks on Scott, moving him away from the debris from the crash.
	- **Fried** ventures into the woods to find food and herbs to help tend to Scott and Merle's wounds. After a while they find 5x Good Berries and a handful of medicinal herbs.
	- **Maylo** also goes into the forest to scout the area out for more enemies and gather kindling for a fire.
- Anxious about the setting sun and the length of **Fried** and **Maylo**'s trips into the woods, **Merle** and **Scraps** attempt to stand the wagon upright so Scraps can begin repairing the wheel.
- Still exhausted from the fight, Scraps and Merle fail to lift the wagon, pinning Scraps under it in the process.
	- Overwhelmed and needing some peace and calm, Fried takes a detour to the lake to clean up.
- Unable to locate or communicate with the others, Merle resorts to cutting off Scraps' arm to pull her out from under the wagon. 
- Just minutes later, both Maylo and Fried return.
	- Merle gets to work sewing Scraps back up while Fried tends to Scott's wounds.
	- Maylo works on getting a fire started
- With the chaos of the past few hours, nobody realized the horses fled when the wagon crashed.
- The party decides to camp out by the lake for the night and look for the horses in the morning.
- In the morning, Maylo finds both horses in a nearby pasture. After luring them back to the makeshift camp, the party can finally get back on the road.
### Where we left off this session:
- The party has just arrived at the Munchkin Mousehole, the southern gate of Emerald City.
- The gravity of the task before them has begun to sink in.
### What we didn't get to:
- Anything I prepped for Emerald City and Southstairs
	- Can probably continue using that prep for session 3, but I might want to revise it.
- 
### My To-Do List:
- [ ] Make Julia a spell sheet (and maybe Asha and Macy too)
	- [ ] Spells to add to Artificer list:
		- Blade Ward (cantrip)
		- Distort Value (lvl 1)
		- Arcane Vigor (lvl 2)
		- Knock (lvl 2)
		- Leomund's Tiny Hut (lvl 3)
- [ ] Consider allowing the PCs to level up from 1->2
- [ ] Plan potential interactions with Mister Boss and the company of the Clock of the Time Dragon
- [ ] Come up with hidden entrances to Southstairs
- [ ] Work with the players to develop their backgrounds further, discuss their character development arc, and maybe even discuss their integration into the plot (if they're up for that)
