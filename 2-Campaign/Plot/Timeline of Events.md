Although he is a wanted criminal in hiding, Liir can’t help but investigate one night when he witnesses a dragon flying through the night sky. Taking Elphaba’s broom, Liir follows the dragon’s path, but he is ambushed by another dragon he hadn’t seen. Riding the dragon is Trism (age 23). Stunned, Liir can’t react in time to dodge a shower of acid sprayed from the green dragon’s mouth. As he raises his arms to cover his face, he loses his balance, falling from the broom into the forest below. Liir is a wanted man with a sizable bounty on his head, Trism knows this. As a soldier of the Emperor’s Emerald Army, it is his duty to turn him in, dead or alive. But, as he begins to guide the dragon toward the direction that Liir fell, he can’t stop thinking about all of the moments they’ve shared together. Filled with a feeling he can’t fully describe, Trism steers the dragon away from Liir’s motionless body, only stopping to retrieve the broom from a nearby canopy.
