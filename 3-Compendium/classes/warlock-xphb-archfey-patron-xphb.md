## Class Features

### Archfey Patron (Level 3)

*Bargain with Whimsical Fey*

Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and [Darkness](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.

### Archfey Spells (Level 3)

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Archfey Spells**

| Warlock Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3 | [Calm Emotions](3-Compendium/spells/calm-emotions-xphb.md), [Faerie Fire](3-Compendium/spells/faerie-fire-xphb.md), [Misty Step](3-Compendium/spells/misty-step-xphb.md), [Phantasmal Force](3-Compendium/spells/phantasmal-force-xphb.md), [Sleep](3-Compendium/spells/sleep-xphb.md) |
| 5 | [Blink](3-Compendium/spells/blink-xphb.md), [Plant Growth](3-Compendium/spells/plant-growth-xphb.md) |
| 7 | [Dominate Beast](3-Compendium/spells/dominate-beast-xphb.md), [Greater Invisibility](3-Compendium/spells/greater-invisibility-xphb.md) |
| 9 | [Dominate Person](3-Compendium/spells/dominate-person-xphb.md), [Seeming](3-Compendium/spells/seeming-xphb.md) |

### Steps of the Fey (Level 3)

Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast [Misty Step](3-Compendium/spells/misty-step-xphb.md) without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).

In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following additional effects.

#### Refreshing Step

Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) [Temporary Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md).

#### Taunting Step

Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have [Disadvantage](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

### Misty Escape (Level 6)

You can cast [Misty Step](3-Compendium/spells/misty-step-xphb.md) as a [Reaction](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) in response to taking damage.

In addition, the following effects are now among your Steps of the Fey options.

#### Disappearing Step

You have the [Invisible](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) condition until the start of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.

#### Dreadful Step

Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) Psychic damage.

### Beguiling Defenses (Level 10)

Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the [Charmed](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition.

In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a [Reaction](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage you take. Once you use this [Reaction](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md), you can't use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md) unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

### Bewitching Magic (Level 14)

Your patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and a spell slot, you can cast [Misty Step](3-Compendium/spells/misty-step-xphb.md) as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot.
