# Unarmed Fighting
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 210*  

When you hit with your Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike. If you aren't holding any weapons or a Shield when you make the attack roll, the `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) becomes a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`).

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) Bludgeoning damage to one creature [Grappled](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by you.
