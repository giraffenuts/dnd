# Drow High Magic
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  

**Prerequisite**: [Elf](3-Compendium/races/elf-xphb.md)

You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the [detect magic](3-Compendium/spells/detect-magic-xphb.md) spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn [levitate](3-Compendium/spells/levitate-xphb.md) and [dispel magic](3-Compendium/spells/dispel-magic-xphb.md), each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
