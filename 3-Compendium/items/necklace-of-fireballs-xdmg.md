# Necklace of Fireballs
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/necklace-of-fireballs.webp#right)

**Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This necklace has `dice:1d6+3|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 3`) beads hanging from it. You can take a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 [Fireball](3-Compendium/spells/fireball-xphb.md) (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the damage of the Fireball by `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) for each bead after the first (maximum `dice:12d6|noform|avg` (`12d6`)).
