# Ring of Shooting Stars
*Very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/ring-of-shooting-stars.webp#right)


You can cast [Dancing Lights](3-Compendium/spells/dancing-lights-xphb.md) or [Light](3-Compendium/spells/light-xphb.md) from the ring.

The ring has 6 charges and regains `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges to use the properties below.

## Faerie Fire

You can expend 1 charge to cast [Faerie Fire](3-Compendium/spells/faerie-fire-xphb.md) from the ring.

## Lightning Spheres

You can expend 2 charges as a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain [Concentration](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds [Dim Light](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) in a 30-foot radius.

As a [Bonus Action](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn't behind [Cover](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md), the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

| Number of Spheres | Lightning Damage |
|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | `dice:4d12\|noform\|avg` (`4d12`) |
| 2 | `dice:5d4\|noform\|avg` (`5d4`) |
| 3 | `dice:2d6\|noform\|avg` (`2d6`) |
| 4 | `dice:2d4\|noform\|avg` (`2d4`) |

## Shooting Stars

You can expend 1 to 3 charges as a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each creature in a 15-foot [Cube [Area of Effect]](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from that point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:5d4|noform|avg` (`5d4`) Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
