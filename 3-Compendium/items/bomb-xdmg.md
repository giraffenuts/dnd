# Bomb
*Explosive*  


- **Cost**: 100 gp
**Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

As an action, you can light a Bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius [Sphere [Area of Effect]](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on that point makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
