# Instrument of the Bards, Canaith Mandolin
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/canaith-mandolin.webp#right)


An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) Psychic damage.

You can play the Canaith Mandolin to cast one of the following spells: [Fly](3-Compendium/spells/fly-xphb.md), [Invisibility](3-Compendium/spells/invisibility-xphb.md), [Levitate](3-Compendium/spells/levitate-xphb.md), [Protection from Evil and Good](3-Compendium/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good-xphb.md), [Cure Wounds](3-Compendium/spells/cure-wounds-xphb.md) (level 3), [Dispel Magic](3-Compendium/spells/dispel-magic-xphb.md), and [Protection from Energy](3-Compendium/spells/protection-from-energy-xphb.md) (Lightning damage only). Once the Canaith Mandolin has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
