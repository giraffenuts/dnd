# Alchemist's Fire
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 50 gp
**Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

When you take the [Attack](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a flask of Alchemist's Fire. Target one creature or object you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and [Proficiency](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md)) or take `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) Fire damage and start burning.
