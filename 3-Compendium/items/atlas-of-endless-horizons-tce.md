# Atlas of Endless Horizons
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/atlas-of-endless-horizons.webp#right)

**Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This thick book is bound in dark leather, crisscrossed with inlaid silver lines suggesting a map or chart. When found, the book contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to the book: [arcane gate](3-Compendium/spells/arcane-gate-xphb.md), [dimension door](3-Compendium/spells/dimension-door-xphb.md), [gate](3-Compendium/spells/gate-xphb.md), [misty step](3-Compendium/spells/misty-step-xphb.md), [plane shift](3-Compendium/spells/plane-shift-xphb.md), [teleportation circle](3-Compendium/spells/teleportation-circle-xphb.md), and [word of recall](3-Compendium/spells/word-of-recall-xphb.md). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the conjuration school.  
- When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If your new position is out of range of the attack, it misses you.
