# Winged Boots
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/winged-boots.webp#right)


These boots have 4 charges and regain `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the boots, you can take a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge, gaining a [Fly Speed](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md) of 30 feet for 1 hour. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.
