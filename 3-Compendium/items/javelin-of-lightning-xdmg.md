# Javelin of Lightning
*Weapon ([javelin](3-Compendium/items/javelin-xphb.md)), uncommon*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/javelin-of-lightning.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d6 P
- **Range**: 30/120
- **Properties**: [Thrown](3-Compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)
**Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Each time you make an attack roll with this magic weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning damage instead of Piercing damage.

## Lightning Bolt

When you throw this weapon at a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms a 5-foot-wide [Line [Area of Effect]](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb.md) between you and the target. The target and each other creature in the [Line [Area of Effect]](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb.md) (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in your hand. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
