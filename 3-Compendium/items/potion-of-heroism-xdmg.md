# Potion of Heroism
*Potion, rare*  


**Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain 10 [Temporary Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the [Bless](3-Compendium/spells/bless-xphb.md) spell (no [Concentration](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) required).

This potion's blue liquid bubbles and steams as if boiling.
