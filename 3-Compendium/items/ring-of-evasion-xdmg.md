# Ring of Evasion
*Rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/ring-of-evasion.webp#right)


This ring has 3 charges, and it regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing the ring, you can take a [Reaction](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to expend 1 charge to succeed on that save instead.
