# Horn of Valhalla, Silver
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/horn-of-valhalla.webp#right)


You can take a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the [Berserker](3-Compendium/bestiary/humanoid/berserker-xmm.md) stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have [Immunity](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Charmed](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) and [Frightened](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A silver horn summons 2 [Berserkers](3-Compendium/bestiary/humanoid/berserker-xmm.md). They are [Friendly [Attitude]](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/friendly-attitude-xphb.md) to you and your allies and follow your commands.
