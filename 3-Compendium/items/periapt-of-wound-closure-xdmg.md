**Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While wearing this pendant, you gain the following benefits.

## Life Preservation

Whenever you make a [Death Saving Throw](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/death-saving-throw-xphb.md), you can change a roll of 9 or lower to a 10, turning a failed save into a successful one.

## Natural Healing Boost

Whenever you roll a [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) Die to regain [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), double the number of [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) it restores.
