*Staff, weapon, legendary (requires attunement by a Spellcaster)*

Bound into this staff is a level 7 spell. The spell is determined when the staff is created and can be of any school of magic. The staff has 6 charges and regains `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 charge to cast its spell. If you expend the staff 's last charge, roll `dice:1d20|noform|avg` (``). On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical [Quarterstaff](3-Compendium/items/quarterstaff-xphb.md).

The spell's saving throw DC is 18, and its attack bonus is `dice:1d20+10|noform|text(+10)`.
