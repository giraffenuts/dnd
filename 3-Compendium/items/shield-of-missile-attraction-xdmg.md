# Shield of Missile Attraction
*Armor ([shield](3-Compendium/items/shield-xphb.md)), cursed item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/shield-of-missile-attraction.webp#right)

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: [Cursed](3-Compendium/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)
**Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this Shield, you have [Resistance](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.

## Curse

This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a [Remove Curse](3-Compendium/spells/remove-curse-xphb.md) spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
