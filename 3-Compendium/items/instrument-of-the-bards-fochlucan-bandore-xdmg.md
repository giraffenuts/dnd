# Instrument of the Bards, Fochlucan Bandore
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/fochlucan-bandore.webp#right)


An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) Psychic damage.

You can play the Fochlucan Bandore to cast one of the following spells: [Fly](3-Compendium/spells/fly-xphb.md), [Invisibility](3-Compendium/spells/invisibility-xphb.md), [Levitate](3-Compendium/spells/levitate-xphb.md), [Protection from Evil and Good](3-Compendium/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good-xphb.md), [Entangle](3-Compendium/spells/entangle-xphb.md), [Faerie Fire](3-Compendium/spells/faerie-fire-xphb.md), [Shillelagh](3-Compendium/spells/shillelagh-xphb.md), and [Speak with Animals](3-Compendium/spells/speak-with-animals-xphb.md). Once the Fochlucan Bandore has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
