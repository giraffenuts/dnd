# Hooded Lantern
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 5 gp
**Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

A Hooded Lantern burns Oil as fuel to cast [Bright Light](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 30-foot radius and [Dim Light](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 30 feet. As a [Bonus Action](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can lower the hood, reducing the light to [Dim Light](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) in a 5-foot radius, or raise it again.
