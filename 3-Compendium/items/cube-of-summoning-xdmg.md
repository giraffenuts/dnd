# Cube of Summoning
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/cube-of-summoning.webp#right)


This Tiny cube looks like a jack-in-the-box. When you wind its crank as a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action, a merry tune emits from the box, the lid pops open, a creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space, and the lid closes. The lid can't otherwise be opened.

Roll on the [Cube of Summoning](3-Compendium/items/cube-of-summoning-xdmg.md) table to determine which spell the cube casts to summon the creature. The spell is cast at level 5 (save DC 17, +9 attack bonus) and doesn't require [Concentration](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration), but you otherwise function as the spell's caster.

Once the cube summons a creature, the cube can't do so again until the next dawn.
