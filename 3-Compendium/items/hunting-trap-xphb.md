# Hunting Trap
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 5 gp
**Weight**: 25.0 lbs.

As a [Utilize](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can set a Hunting Trap, which is a sawtooth steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) Piercing damage and have its [Speed](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 Piercing damage to the trapped creature.
