# Eyes of Minute Seeing
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  



These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, your vision improves significantly out to a range of 1 foot, granting you [Darkvision](3-Compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) within that range and [Advantage](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) checks made to examine something within that range.
