# Hat of Vermin
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/hat-of-vermin.webp#right)


This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can take a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge and summon your choice of a [Bat](3-Compendium/bestiary/beast/bat-xmm.md), a [Frog](3-Compendium/bestiary/beast/frog-xmm.md), or a [Rat](3-Compendium/bestiary/beast/rat-xmm.md). The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The creature is [Indifferent [Attitude]](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/indifferent-attitude-xphb.md) toward you and other creatures, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
