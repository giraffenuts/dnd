# Nature's Mantle
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/natures-mantle.webp#right)


This cloak shifts color and texture to blend with the terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, you can use it as a [Spellcasting Focus](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/spellcasting-focus-xphb.md) for your Druid and Ranger spells.

While you are in an area that is [Lightly Obscured](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md), you can [Hide](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Hide) as a [Bonus Action](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) even if you are being directly observed.
