# Fulminating Treatise
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/fulminating-treatise.webp#right)

**Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This thick, scorched spellbook reeks of smoke and ozone, and sparks of energy crackles along the edges of its pages. When found, the book contains the following spells: [contingency](3-Compendium/spells/contingency-xphb.md), [fireball](3-Compendium/spells/fireball-xphb.md), [gust of wind](3-Compendium/spells/gust-of-wind-xphb.md), [Leomund's tiny hut](3-Compendium/spells/leomunds-tiny-hut-xphb.md), [magic missile](3-Compendium/spells/magic-missile-xphb.md), [thunderwave](3-Compendium/spells/thunderwave-xphb.md), and [wall of force](3-Compendium/spells/wall-of-force-xphb.md). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the evocation school.  
- When one creature you can see takes damage from an evocation spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to deal an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) force damage to the creature and knock the creature [prone](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) if it is Large or smaller.
