# Ring of Regeneration
*Very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/ring-of-regeneration.webp#right)


While wearing this ring, you regain `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) every 10 minutes if you have at least 1 [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) days if you have at least 1 [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) the whole time.
