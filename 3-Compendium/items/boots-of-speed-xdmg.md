# Boots of Speed
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/boots-of-speed.webp#right)


While you wear these boots, you can take a [Bonus Action](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your [Speed](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md), and any creature that makes an [Opportunity Attack](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack) against you has [Disadvantage](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When you've used the boots' property for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you until you finish a [Long Rest](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).
