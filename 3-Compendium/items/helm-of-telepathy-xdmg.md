# Helm of Telepathy
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/helm-of-telepathy.webp#right)


While wearing this helm, you have telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and you can cast [Detect Thoughts](3-Compendium/spells/detect-thoughts-xphb.md) or [Suggestion](3-Compendium/spells/suggestion-xphb.md) (save DC 13) from the helm. Once either spell is cast from the helm, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.
