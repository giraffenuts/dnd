# Potion of Poison
*Potion, uncommon*  


**Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a [Potion of Healing](3-Compendium/items/potion-of-healing-xdmg.md) or another beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. [Identify](3-Compendium/spells/identify-xphb.md) reveals its true nature.

If you drink this potion, you take `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) Poison damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 1 hour.
