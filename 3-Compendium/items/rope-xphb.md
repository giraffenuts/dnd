# Rope
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 1 gp
**Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

As a [Utilize](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can tie a knot with Rope if you succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. The Rope can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

You can bind an unwilling creature with the Rope only if the creature has the [Grappled](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled), [Incapacitated](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), or [Restrained](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition. If the creature's legs are bound, the creature has the [Restrained](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until it escapes. Escaping the Rope requires the creature to make a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check as an action.
