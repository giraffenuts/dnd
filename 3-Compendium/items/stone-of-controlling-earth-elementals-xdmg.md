# Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/stone-of-controlling-earth-elementals.webp#right)


While touching this 5-pound stone to the ground, you can take a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to summon an [Earth Elemental](3-Compendium/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental-xmm.md). The elemental appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [Initiative](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [Bonus Action](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md). The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
