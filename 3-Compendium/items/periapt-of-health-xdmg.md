# Periapt of Health
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Compendium/items/img/periapt-of-health.webp#right)

**Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While wearing this pendant, you can take a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to regain `dice:2d4+2|noform|avg` (`2d4 + 2`) [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

In addition, you have [Advantage](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws to avoid or end the [Poisoned](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition while you wear this pendant.
