# Gold Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient gold dragon's lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Dream Messenger.** While in its lair, the dragon can cast [Dream](3-Compendium/spells/dream-xphb.md), requiring no Material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability. When casting the spell this way, the dragon can target any creature within 6 miles.  
- **Foretelling Fog.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [Lightly Obscured](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md) by opalescent fog. While in that area, creatures can't be [surprised](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Surprised), as the fog swirls into shapes that warn of danger.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
