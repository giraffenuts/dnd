# Arch-hag

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an arch-hag's lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Lapsus Linguae.** Creatures (excluding the hag and its allies) within 1 mile of the lair subtract `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) from any ability check they make when they take the [Influence](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Influence) action.  
- **Meddlesome Magic.** Whenever a creature other than the hag or its allies finishes a [Long Rest](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md) while within 1 mile of the lair, the next time that creature casts a spell using a spell slot, it also casts [Confusion](3-Compendium/spells/confusion-xphb.md) centered on itself. The spell uses the creature's spellcasting ability and doesn't require [Concentration](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration).  

If the arch-hag is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
