# Sphinx

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a sphinx of lore's or sphinx of valor's lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Distant Sight.** While in its lair, the sphinx can cast [Clairvoyance](3-Compendium/spells/clairvoyance-xphb.md), requiring no spell components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action. When cast this way, the spell's range is 1 mile.  
- **Infusion of Knowledge.** Whenever the sphinx or one of its allies takes a [Study](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Study) action while within 1 mile of the lair, it adds `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) to any ability check it makes for that action.  

If the sphinx dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
