# [Minotaur Skeleton](3-Compendium\bestiary\undead/minotaur-skeleton-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 283*  

Minotaur skeletons are the reanimated remains of minotaurs or the skeletons of multiple creatures merged into a minotaur-like shape. These hulking skeletons have greater speed and might than smaller skeletons. They menace the living with their horns and mighty greataxes.

## Skeletons

*Ossified Evil*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Shadowfell), Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

Skeletons rise at the summons of necromancers and foul spirits. Whether they're the remains of the ancient dead or fresh bones bound to morbid ambitions, they commit deathless work for whatever forces reanimated them, often serving as guardians, soldiers, or laborers. In rare cases, skeletons are reanimated but given no particular direction. Roll on or choose a result from the Skeleton Pantomimes table to inspire how undirected skeletons behave.

**Skeleton Pantomimes**
