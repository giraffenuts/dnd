# [Haunting Revenant](3-Compendium\bestiary\undead/haunting-revenant-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 260*  

Haunting revenants possess ruins and forsaken places connected with their deaths—such as abandoned buildings, wrecked ships, or junk heaps. These revenants lurk in plain sight, waiting for their foes to near, then trap their victims within their massive bodies. Those inside a revenant might be battered by animate furnishings or more unsettling manifestations of the revenant's hatred.

The places haunting revenants lurk swiftly gain infamous reputations.

## Revenants

*Vengeance from beyond the Grave*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Swamp, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Wrathful spirits bent on revenge, revenants possess corpses and other materials, using them to seek justice or vent their rage on those who wronged them. Revenants refuse to rest until those they seek to punish are no more. If their bodies are destroyed, revenants claim new forms and continue their ruthless quests.
