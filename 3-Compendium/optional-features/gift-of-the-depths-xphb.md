# Gift of the Depths
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 156*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th Warlock

You can breathe underwater, and you gain a [Swim Speed](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md).

You can also cast [Water Breathing](3-Compendium/spells/water-breathing-xphb.md) once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way again when you finish a [Long Rest](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).
