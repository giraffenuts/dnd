# Mind Sharpener
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 22*  

The infused item can send a jolt to the wearer to refocus their mind. The item has 4 charges. When the wearer fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain [concentration](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on a spell, the wearer can use its reaction to expend 1 of the item's charges to succeed instead. The item regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn.
