# Pact of the Chain
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 157*  

You learn the [Find Familiar](3-Compendium/spells/find-familiar-xphb.md) spell and can cast it as a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [Imp](3-Compendium/bestiary/fiend/imp-xmm.md), [Pseudodragon](3-Compendium/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon-xmm.md), [Quasit](3-Compendium/bestiary/fiend/quasit-xmm.md), [Skeleton](3-Compendium/bestiary/undead/skeleton-xmm.md), [Slaad Tadpole](3-Compendium/bestiary/aberration/slaad-tadpole-xmm.md), [Sphinx of Wonder](3-Compendium/bestiary/celestial/sphinx-of-wonder-xmm.md), [Sprite](3-Compendium/bestiary/fey/sprite-xmm.md), or [Venomous Snake](3-Compendium/bestiary/beast/venomous-snake-xmm.md) (see appendix B for the familiar's stat block).

Additionally, when you take the [Attack](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Attack) action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its [Reaction](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md).
