*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 156*  

**Prerequisite**: 9th Warlock

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature, and you can expend one of your [Hit Point Dice](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-point-dice-xphb.md) to roll it and regain a number of [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md)).
