# Yellow Mold
*Generic Hazard*  

Yellow mold grows in dark places, and one patch covers a 5-foot square. If touched, the mold ejects a cloud of spores that fills a 10-foot [Cube [Area of Effect]](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d10|noform|avg|text(11)` (`2d10`) Poison damage and have the [Poisoned](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 1 minute. While Poisoned in this way, the creature takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d10`) Poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Direct sunlight or any amount of Fire damage destroys a patch of yellow mold.
