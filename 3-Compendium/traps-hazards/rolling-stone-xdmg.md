# Rolling Stone
*Generic Hazard*  

When a creature moves onto a hidden pressure plate, a 5-foot-radius orb of solid stone is released from a secret compartment and begins to roll. The stone and all creatures nearby roll Initiative; the stone gets a +8 bonus on its Initiative roll.

On its turn, the stone moves 60 feet in one direction, changing course if redirected by an obstacle. The stone can move through creatures' spaces, and creatures can move through the stone's space, treating it as [Difficult Terrain](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md). Whenever the stone enters a creature's space for the first time on a turn or a creature enters the stone's space while the stone is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:10d10|noform|avg|text(55)` (`10d10`) Bludgeoning damage and have the [Prone](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition.

The stone stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can't go around corners, but creative dungeon builders incorporate curving turns into nearby passages that allow the stone to keep moving.

## Detect and Disarm

As a [Study](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Study) action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pressure plate and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, deducing the pressure plate's function on a successful check. Wedging an Iron Spike or a similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering.

## Destroy the Stone

The stone is a Large object that has AC 17, HP 100, a [Damage Threshold](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/damage-threshold-xphb.md) of 10, and [Immunity](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Poison and Psychic damage.

## Slow the Stone

As an action, a creature can try to slow down the stone with a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. If the check is successful, the distance the stone moves on its turn is reduced by 15 feet. If that distance drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.
