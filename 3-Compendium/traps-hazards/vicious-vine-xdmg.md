# Vicious Vine
*Generic Hazard*  

Vicious vines are animated by magic. They often cling to doorways, archways, walls, and statuary. Until a vicious vine moves, there's nothing to distinguish it from an inanimate vine.

Each vicious vine has AC 11; HP 16; and Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Psychic damage. When a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the vine for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the vine tries to coil around that creature. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or have the [Grappled](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 12). While Grappled in this way, the target takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d10`) Necrotic damage from the vine's life-draining thorns at the start of each of the target's turns. The vine can grapple only one creature at a time.

As an [Influence](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Influence) action, a character under the effect of a [Speak with Plants](3-Compendium/spells/speak-with-plants-xphb.md) spell or similar magic can try to persuade the vine to release its victim, doing so with a successful DC 10 Charisma ([Persuasion](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. A creature released by the vine in this way won't be attacked by that vine again for the next 24 hours.

## At Higher Levels

You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the Necrotic damage, the save DC, and the escape DC, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Necrotic Damage | Save/Escape DC |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| 5–10 | 11 (`dice:2d10\|noform\|avg` (`2d10`)) | 14 |
| 11–16 | 22 (`dice:4d10\|noform\|avg` (`4d10`)) | 16 |
| 17–20 | 55 (`dice:10d10\|noform\|avg` (`10d10`)) | 18 |
