# Falling onto a Creature
*Wilderness Hazard*  

If a creature falls into the space of a second creature and neither of them is Tiny, the second creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be impacted by the falling creature, and any damage resulting from the fall is divided evenly between them. The impacted creature is also knocked [prone](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone), unless it is two or more sizes larger than the falling creature.
