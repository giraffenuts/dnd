# Falling into Water
*Wilderness Hazard*  

A creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its reaction to make a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to hit the surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved.
