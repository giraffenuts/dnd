# Poisonous Gas
*Generic Hazard*  

Poisonous gas is usually encountered in an enclosed space, such as a sewer or sealed tomb. The gas fills as much space as it can, up to a maximum of ten 10-foot [Cube [Area of Effect]](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md). The transparent gas carries a foul odor. The gas is continuously or periodically replenished by some natural or magical source, though a strong wind disperses the gas for 1 minute.

Any creature that enters poisonous gas for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d10`) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures in the gas also have [Disadvantage](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on [Death Saving Throw](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/death-saving-throw-xphb.md).

## At Higher Levels

You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the Poison damage and the save DC, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Poison Damage | Save DC |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| 5–10 | 11 (`dice:2d10\|noform\|avg` (`2d10`)) | 14 |
| 11–16 | 22 (`dice:4d10\|noform\|avg` (`4d10`)) | 16 |
| 17–20 | 55 (`dice:10d10\|noform\|avg` (`10d10`)) | 18 |
