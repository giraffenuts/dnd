# Poisoned Darts
*Generic Hazard*  

When a creature moves onto this trap's pressure plate for the first time on a turn, poisoned darts shoot from tubes embedded in the surrounding walls. The holes that house these tubes are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or skillfully hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes.

Each creature in the darts' path must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) darts, taking `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(3)` (`1d6`) Poison damage per dart.

## Detect and Disarm

As a [Search](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Search) action, a creature can examine the walls and make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, detecting the holes on a successful check. Plugging all the holes with wax, cloth, or detritus prevents the darts from firing.

As a [Search](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Search) action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pressure plate and make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, detecting the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging an [Iron Spike](3-Compendium/items/iron-spikes-xphb.md) or a similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering.

## At Higher Levels

You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing each dart's Poison damage as follows: `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) at levels 5–10, `dice:4d6|noform|avg|text(14)` (`4d6`) at levels 11–16, or `dice:7d6|noform|avg|text(24)` (`7d6`) at levels 17–20.
