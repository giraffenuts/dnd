# Conjure Woodland Beings
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You conjure nature spirits that flit around you in a 10-foot Emanation for the duration. Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes `dice:5d8|noform|avg` (`5d8`) Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

In addition, you can take the [Disengage](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Disengage) action as a [Bonus Action](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) for the spell's duration.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger)
