# Conjure Elemental
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You conjure a Large, intangible spirit from the Elemental Planes that appears in an unoccupied space within range. Choose the spirit's element, which determines its damage type: air (Lightning), earth (Thunder), fire (Fire), or water (Cold). The spirit lasts for the duration.

Whenever a creature you can see enters the spirit's space or starts its turn within 5 feet of the spirit, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw if the spirit has no creature [Restrained](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained). On failed save, the target takes `dice:8d8|noform|avg` (`8d8`) damage of the spirit's type, and the target has the [Restrained](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until the spell ends. At the start of each of its turns, the [Restrained](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) target repeats the save. On a failed save, the target takes `dice:4d8|noform|avg` (`4d8`) damage of the spirit's type. On a successful save, the target isn't [Restrained](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the spirit.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:2d8|noform|avg|text(2d8)` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
