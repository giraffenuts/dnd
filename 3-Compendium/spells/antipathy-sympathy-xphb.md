# Antipathy/Sympathy
*8th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a mix of vinegar and honey
- **Duration:** 10 day

As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that save:

- **Antipathy.** The creature has the [Frightened](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition. The [Frightened](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creature must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from the target, moving by the safest route.  
- **Sympathy.** The creature has the [Charmed](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition. The [Charmed](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature must use its movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the target, moving by the safest route. If the creature is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can't willingly move away. If the target damages the [Charmed](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature, that creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.  

## Ending the Effect

If the [Frightened](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) or [Charmed](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.
