# Maze
*8th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can take a [Study](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Study) action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
