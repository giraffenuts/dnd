# Delayed Blast Fireball
*7th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a ball of bat guano and sulfur
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of yellow light flashes from you, then condenses at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, the bead explodes, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes Fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spell's base damage is `dice:12d6|noform|avg` (`12d6`), and the damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) whenever your turn ends and the spell hasn't ended.

If a creature touches the glowing bead before the spell ends, that creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends, causing the bead to explode. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. If the thrown bead enters a creature's space or collides with a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.

When the bead explodes, flammable objects in the explosion that aren't being worn or carried start [burning](3-Compendium/traps-hazards/burning-xphb.md).

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The base damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each spell slot level above 7.
