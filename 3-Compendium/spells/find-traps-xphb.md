# Find Traps
*2nd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the [Alarm](3-Compendium/spells/alarm-xphb.md) or [Glyph of Warding](3-Compendium/spells/glyph-of-warding-xphb.md) spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-xphb-divine-soul-xge)
