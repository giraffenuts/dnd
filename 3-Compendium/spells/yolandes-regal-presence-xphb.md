# Yolande's Regal Presence
*5th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a miniature tiara
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You surround yourself with unearthly majesty in a 10-foot Emanation. Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`) Psychic damage and has the [Prone](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition, and you can push it up to 10 feet away. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Paladin (Oath of Glory)](list-spells-classes-paladin-xphb-oath-of-glory-xphb)
