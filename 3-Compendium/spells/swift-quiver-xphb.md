# Swift Quiver
*5th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a Quiver worth 1+ GP
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast the spell and as a [Bonus Action](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) until it ends, you can make two attacks with a weapon that fires Arrows or Bolts, such as a Longbow or a Light Crossbow. The spell magically creates the ammunition needed for each attack. Each Arrow or Bolt created by the spell deals damage like a nonmagical piece of ammunition of its kind and disintegrates immediately after it hits or misses.
