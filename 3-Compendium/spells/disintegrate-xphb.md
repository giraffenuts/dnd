# Disintegrate
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a lodestone and dust
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by [Wall of Force](3-Compendium/spells/wall-of-force-xphb.md).

A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `dice:10d6+40|noform|avg` (`10d6 + 40`) Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a [True Resurrection](3-Compendium/spells/true-resurrection-xphb.md) or a [Wish](3-Compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-Cube portion of it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(3d6)` for each spell slot level above 6.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard)
