# Produce Flame
*cantrip, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minute

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds [Bright Light](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) Fire damage.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`) when you reach levels `dice:2d8|noform|avg|text(5)` (`2d8`), `dice:3d8|noform|avg|text(11)` (`3d8`), and `dice:4d8|noform|avg|text(17)` (`4d8`).

**Classes**: [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb)
