# Spike Growth
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, seven thorns
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

The ground in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes [Difficult Terrain](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`) Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area when the spell is cast must take a [Search](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Search) action and succeed on a Wisdom ([Perception](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](3-Compendium/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
