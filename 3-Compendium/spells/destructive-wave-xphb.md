Destructive energy ripples outward from you in a 30-foot Emanation. Each creature you choose in the Emanation makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes `dice:5d6|noform|avg` (`5d6`) Thunder damage and `dice:5d6|noform|avg` (`5d6`) Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice) and has the [Prone](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

**Classes**: [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin); [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin)
