# Catapult
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range that isn't being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) bludgeoning damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of objects that you can target with this spell increases by 5 pounds, and the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)`, for each slot level above 1st.
