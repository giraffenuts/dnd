# Jallarzi's Storm of Radiance
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a pinch of phosphorus
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You unleash a storm of flashing light and raging thunder in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point you can see within range. While in this area, creatures have the [Blinded](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [Deafened](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) conditions, and they can't cast spells with a Verbal component.

When the storm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) Radiant damage and `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Radiant and Thunder damage increase by `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(1d10)` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard (Evoker)](list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-evoker-xphb)
