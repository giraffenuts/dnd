# Dissonant Whispers
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a discordant melody in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) Psychic damage and must immediately use its [Reaction](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md), if available, to move as far away from you as it can, using the safest route. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer (Aberrant Sorcery)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-xphb-aberrant-sorcery-xphb); [Warlock (Great Old One Patron)](list-spells-classes-warlock-xphb-great-old-one-patron-xphb)
