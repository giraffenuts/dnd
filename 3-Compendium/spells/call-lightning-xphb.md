# Call Lightning
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above yourself. It takes the shape of a Cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius.

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:3d10|noform|avg` (`3d10`) Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [Magic](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to call down lightning in that way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you're outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`).

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(1d10)` for each spell slot level above 3.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb)
