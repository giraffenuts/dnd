# Mind Blank
*8th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 24 hour

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has [Immunity](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Psychic damage and the [Charmed](3-Compendium/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spell—not even [Wish](3-Compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md)—can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard (Abjurer)](list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-abjurer-xphb)
