# Maddening Darkness
*8th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, a drop of pitch mixed with a drop of mercury
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with [darkvision](3-Compendium/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) can't see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.

Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking `dice:8d8|noform|avg` (`8d8`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard (Evoker)](list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-evoker-xphb)
