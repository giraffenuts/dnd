# Erupting Earth
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a piece of obsidian
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:3d12|noform|avg` (`3d12`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d12|noform|avg|text(1d12)` for each slot level above 3rd.
