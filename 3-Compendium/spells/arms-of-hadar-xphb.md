# Arms of Hadar
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Invoking Hadar, you cause tendrils to erupt from yourself. Each creature in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) Necrotic damage and can't take Reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Sorcerer (Aberrant Sorcery)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-xphb-aberrant-sorcery-xphb)
