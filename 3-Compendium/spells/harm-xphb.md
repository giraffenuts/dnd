# Harm
*6th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash virulent magic on a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice:14d6|noform|avg` (`14d6`) Necrotic damage, and its [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage it took. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. This spell can't reduce a target's [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) maximum below 1.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-xphb-divine-soul-xge)
