# Cloudkill
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow-green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by [Gust of Wind](3-Compendium/spells/gust-of-wind-xphb.md)) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is [Heavily Obscured](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md).

Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:5d8|noform|avg` (`5d8`) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Artificer (Alchemist)](list-spells-classes-artificer-alchemist-tce); [Druid (Circle of Spores)](list-spells-classes-druid-xphb-circle-of-spores-tce); [Paladin (Oath of Conquest)](list-spells-classes-paladin-xphb-oath-of-conquest-xge)
