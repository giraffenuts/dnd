# Summon Celestial
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a reliquary worth 500+ GP
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a Celestial spirit. It manifests in an angelic form in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [Celestial Spirit](3-Compendium/bestiary/celestial/celestial-spirit-xphb.md) stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Avenger or [Defender](3-Compendium/items/defender-xdmg.md). Your choice determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [Initiative](3-Compendium/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](3-Compendium/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin); [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin); [Warlock (Celestial Patron)](list-spells-classes-warlock-xphb-celestial-patron-xphb); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-xphb-divine-soul-xge)
