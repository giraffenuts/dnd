# Chapter 5: Feats
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024), p. 199* 

![The Weathermay-Foxgrove Tw...](3-Compendium/books/players-handbook-2024/img/158-06-001-weathermay-foxgrove-alanik-arthur.webp#center "The Weathermay-Foxgrove Twins, Gennifer and Laurie, along with the investigators Alanik Ray and Arthur Sedgwick, fight to escape the horrors of Castle Ravenloft")

This chapter offers a collection of feats, which are special features not tied to a character class. A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

The sections below explain the parts of a feat and list a variety of feat options separated into categories.

Your background gives you a feat, and at certain levels, your class gives you the "Ability Score Improvement" feat or the choice of another feat for which you qualify.

By whatever means you acquire a feat, you can take it only once unless its description says otherwise.

## Feat Descriptions

This chapter's feats are organized by category—"Origin", "General", "Fighting Style", or "Epic Boon"—and alphabetized in each category. All the feats are listed alphabetically in the "Feat List table". If a feat can be taken more than once, an asterisk appears after its name in that table.

### Parts of a Feat

The description of a feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the feat's name.

#### Category

A feat is a member of a category, which is noted in the feat. If you're instructed to choose a feat from a specific category, such as the Origin category, that category must appear under the feat's name. If you're instructed to choose a feat and no category is specified, you can choose from any category.

#### Prerequisite

To take a feat, you must meet any prerequisite in its description unless a feature allows you to take the feat without the prerequisite. If a prerequisite includes a class, you must have at least 1 level in that class to take the feat.

#### Benefit

The benefits of a feat are detailed after any prerequisites are listed. If you have a feat, you gain its benefits.

#### Repeatable

A feat can be taken only once unless its description states otherwise in a "Repeatable" subsection.
